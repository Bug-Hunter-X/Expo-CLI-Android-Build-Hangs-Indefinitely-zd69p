This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app. The error message is vague, and does not provide much information about the root cause.  The build process hangs indefinitely, never completing successfully. It appears to be related to the Android build system, but the specifics are unclear.  No relevant errors are reported in the terminal output beyond the process hanging. This makes it difficult to debug and find a solution.  The problem only occurs on a specific machine/environment. The codebase works fine on other systems when building the android app.
