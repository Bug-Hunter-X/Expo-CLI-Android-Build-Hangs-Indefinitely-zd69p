The exact solution depends on the root cause, which is environment-specific.  There is no one-size-fits-all fix. However, here are some troubleshooting steps:

1. **Update Android SDK and Build Tools:** Ensure you have the latest Android SDK and build tools installed.  You can check for updates in the Android Studio SDK Manager.
2. **Check Java Version:** Verify that your Java version is compatible with the Android SDK.  Update or reinstall Java if necessary.
3. **Check System Resources:** Ensure your machine has sufficient RAM and disk space.  A lack of resources can cause builds to hang.
4. **Gradle Cache:** Clear the Gradle cache. The cache directory is typically located in `.gradle` in your user directory.  Delete the `caches` folder within it.
5. **Antivirus Software:** Temporarily disable your antivirus or security software.  In rare cases, this software can interfere with the build process.
6. **Environment Variables:** Review and confirm that your system environment variables are set up correctly. There may be an incorrectly defined path variable causing issues. 
7. **Reinstall Expo CLI:** Try reinstalling the Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
8. **Clean Project:** Completely remove the `android` folder in your Expo project and re-generate it:  `expo prebuild` followed by `expo build:android`. 

If none of these steps work, provide detailed information about your system and environment for more effective troubleshooting.
